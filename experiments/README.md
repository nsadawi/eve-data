Folders TS3/ 4,5,6 and 7 contain:
  - Files from the corresponding assays (TS*.csv is the merged version)
  - Averaged version of the merged file
  - Labeled version of the merged file

I have run WEKA's multiclass NB, kNN (with k = 5) and Decision Trees (j48) on TS[3-7]-Labeled.csv and the results are in Eve-NB-kNN-DTrees.csv

The results are simple confusion matrix based stats and counts
